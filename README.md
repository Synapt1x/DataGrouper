### Data Grouper

## Created by: Chris Cadonic
## For use in data aggregation for statistical analysis

# Utility

This program is specific to grouping and setting up data for analysis for
previous projects conducted in Dr. Modirrousta's laboratory.

Data is not attached specifically to this, although this would be the third
standalone script developed for aggregating data form directories from a
specific format.

Plans for this project are to initially collect, group, and format data to
be ready for statistical analysis for two particular outstanding projects in
Dr. Modirrousta's lab.

# Plans for this Project

I plan to extend the scope of this project to also combine my previous work
for Dr. Kelly [here](https://github.com/Synapt1x/PythonDataProcessor),
incorporating the GUI developed there for amalgamating data for outstanding
projects in her laboratory as well.

I will be developing this program on my own time, which will use the GUI to
ask users to specify where data is located, where they wish output files to
be, and for there to be an interactive editing guide that allows users to
determine which columns are necessary from their data and warns the user of
any issues with their dataset. Different output formats, for instance simple
 Excel spreadshet outputs, SPSS outputs, or R outputs, will all be
 incorporated into the final product.

# Running

Running this will be done via an executeable by freezing the project, much
like what was done [here](https://github.com/Synapt1x/PythonDataProcessor).

# To be continued...

I will continue to work on this as I have time, so that I can maintain and
distribute this software for other labs to use in situations where they
require data amalgamation for data sets that would not be efficient to do so
 manually.
